Ugh… This module is so dumb… Why do we have to complete a 10 hour quiz EVERYDAY?
Having to do them in a university building is also so cringe… 
Eh… whatever, it is what it is. Let’s go grab a cup of coffee first.

Nice! There’s no queue for the coffee! I’ll save myself a seat first.
YOU PLACE YOUR LAPTOP ON THE TABLE CLOSEST TO YOU. 
I can’t wait to get my favorite venti white mocha with 10 pumps of caramel, 2 dashes of tabasco, 7 sprinkles of cinnamon, and 3 shavings of 63% dark chocolate from Uganda.
